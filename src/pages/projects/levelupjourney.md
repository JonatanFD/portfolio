# Engineering Academic Success through Gamification

**Role:** Fullstack Lead & Software Architect  
**Institution:** Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC)  
**Status:** Pilot Successfully Completed | Faculty Endorsed

## 📌 The Challenge: Addressing IT Student Attrition
In the early stages of Software Engineering and Computer Science programs, universities face a critical **30% dropout rate**. Traditional learning methods often fail to keep students engaged with complex technical subjects.

**Level Up Journey** was designed to solve this by transforming the learning curve into a gamified experience. The project aimed to **reduce attrition by 10%** and improve average academic performance by 4–5 points on a 20-point scale.

## 🏗️ Leadership & Architectural Vision
As the Technical Lead and Architect, my focus was not just on writing code, but on designing a resilient ecosystem capable of scaling to thousands of students.

### Strategic Design
I implemented **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to ensure the system remained modular and maintainable. The architecture was split into distinct business domains: *Gamification, Community, Code Execution, and Identity.*

> **Key Leadership Fact:** I led a development team selected exclusively from the **Top 10%** of the Software Engineering program, orchestrating a polyglot microservices environment (Java & Go).

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (High-Level)
We selected a modern stack focused on high availability and low-latency feedback:

* **Core:** Polyglot microservices built with **Spring Boot (Java)** and **Gin (Golang)**.
* **Frontend:** A responsive, interactive UI built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.
* **Messaging:** Event-driven communication via **Apache Kafka** to ensure system decoupling.
* **Infrastructure:** Containerized deployment designed for **Azure Container Apps** and managed PostgreSQL databases.

---

## 🚀 Measured Impact & Outcomes
This project moved beyond a "coding exercise" into a validated educational tool:

* **Institutional Endorsement:** Following a rigorous technical review, the project received formal approval from the University’s Academic Direction.
* **Pilot Success:** We conducted a 3-week Proof of Concept with 60 students. **85% of participants** demonstrated sustained engagement throughout the pilot.
* **Innovative Feedback Loop:** We developed a real-time code execution engine (isolated via Docker), providing students with instant feedback on their logic—a crucial factor in maintaining learning momentum.

## 🔮 Roadmap to Production
Following the successful pilot, the platform is positioned for a full-scale **Azure** migration, focusing on:
1.  **Global Scalability:** Leveraging Azure Container Apps to support the entire engineering faculty.
2.  **Enterprise Reliability:** Transitioning to Azure Service Bus for mission-critical messaging.
3.  **Predictive Analytics:** Utilizing activity data to identify "at-risk" students before they decide to drop out.

> **Personal Contribution:**
> Beyond the architecture, I was responsible for the global technical vision and solving critical bottlenecks, such as implementing low-latency communication (gRPC) between the challenge engine and the secure code runner.
